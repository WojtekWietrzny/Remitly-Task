# Remitly Task
## Wojciech Wietrzny
### How to run the code:
In order to run the code, you have to run the main method in JsonSolution class
and include an absolute path to the JSON that you intend to verify as a program argument in the configuration. In my project the JSON to verify is located in src/main/resources/com.example/remitlytask named data.JSON

The project also contains unit tests in the test directory
